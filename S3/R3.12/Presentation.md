Smartphones are everywhere: in your pockets, on your table, and even with you in the bathroom. Today, almost everyone has a smartphone, because it’s convenient, even necessary in many cases.

  

The average person spends more than four hours a day looking at their phone; that’s fifteen hundred hours a year, more than two whole months.

  

In a nutshell, smartphones are the piece of tech everyone has and nobody can get rid of. But what happens if you break it? Because, well, in the two months you spend looking at your phone each year, there must be some time when you will accidentally drop it,

  

or unplug the charger the wrong way, or spill your coffee on it. You might have tried to get it repaired. However, you would have noticed that phone repair prices are quite high:

  

for example, you would have to pay around three hundred dollars to get your screen repaired on the latest iPhone, and more than five hundred to get your charging port replaced; if you have a cheaper phone, chances are that you would rather buy a brand new one than repair your old device for the same price.

  

And if you do buy a new one, chances are that the old one is going to end either in a dead phone drawer, or as electronic waste. Don’t you find it annoying that even a tiny problem like a broken charging port can ruin your whole device?

  

This is where Fairphone comes into play. Fairphones are phones that are designed to entirely come apart with only the help of a regular screwdriver, so that you can change any problematic part in less than fifteen minutes.

  

Spare parts are available on the brand’s website, and if you fear breaking your phone by taking it apart you can send it to customer service to have it fixed for free, no matter how long it has been since you bought your device.

  

Fairphone is a Dutch company created in twenty eleven first as a nonprofit organization, working for human rights in the tungsten and lithium mines that supply commercial phones materials.

  

It’s only after finding that almost all of these mines don’t respect basic human rights that they decided to create their own phone brand. Their first phone was available in December twenty thirteen;

  

with only around sixty thousand units sold, versus eighty millions for the latest Samsung at the time, it would not seem like they were about to revolutionize the smartphone industry. The Fairphone One had multiple issues that slowed down the sales;

  

it was not modular, had poor design choices that made it break easily and was really pricey for the time. However, it carried with it the core of the Fairphone values: being made one hundred percent out of recycled,

  

fairtrade and conflict-free materials, the Fairphone One’s goal was to offer a smartphone that was both usable, environment-friendly and suffering-free. With the following phones, Fairphone managed

  

to improve their design to become a real competitor to bigger smartphone manufacturers. In twenty fifteen, the Fairphone Two was launched, being the first fully modular phone avilable on the public market.

  

In twenty sixteen, they managed a partnership with Qualcomm, allowing them to offer extended warranty on all of their hardware. In twenty twenty, two hundred thousand units were sold, and in twenty twenty three their latest smartphone, the Fairphone Five,

  

was available to the public. With almost the same specs of the Google Pixel 6a, the Fairphone Five positions itself in the mid-upper range of smartphones at the time,

  

and with a price of six hundred dollars, it represents the best value for money given that it will last at least twice as long as another phone. As of today, Fairphone is no longer just phones:

  

you can buy fair chargers, fair earbuds and even fair headsets, all of them carrying the core values of Fairphone: modularity, recycling and fairness.

  

In a nutshell, Fairphone is by far the fairest option you got if you want your tech choices to have an impact: by prioritizing fair labor practices, environmentally friendly materials, and modular design, Fairphone places itself as the greenest option you got if you want to give your smartphone choice a meaning.
